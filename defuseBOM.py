__doc__ = """%s: Remove the BOM from BOM-containing UTF-8 text files. These are, almost
without exception, produced by Microsoft products, especially under Windows. 

Hey Microsoft: fuck you for deciding to produce noncompliant files instead of 
adequately tracking metadata. Stop shitting all over people's data to mark
your turf and/or cover your mistakes. It's bad information citizenship.

Usage:
    
    %s --help
        Show this help message

    %s FILE [FILE2, FILE3, ...]
        Rewrite the specified UTF-8 files in place, removing any leading BOM.

This program will not work if the input file is encoded with any encoding other
than UTF-8. (It WILL work, i.e. do nothing, if the input file is UTF-8 with no
BOM.) It will not produce output files in any format other than BOMless UTF-8.
Use a program like iconv for more general conversions.
